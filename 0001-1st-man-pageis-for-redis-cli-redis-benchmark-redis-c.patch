Subject: [PATCH 1/2] 1st man pageis for - redis-cli - redis-benchmark -
 redis-check-aof - redis-check-rdb - redis-server - redis.conf

as redis-sentinel is a symlink to redis-server, same page can be used (also symlinked)
redis.conf can also be used for sentinel.conf

+.TH REDIS-BENCHMARK 1 "2016" "Redis" "User commands"
+.SH NAME
+redis\-benchmark \- Redis benchmark
+
+.SH SYNOPSIS
+.B redis\-benchmark
+[ options ]
+.LP
+
+.SH DESCRIPTION
+\fBRedis\fP is an open source (BSD licensed), in-memory data structure store,
+used as database, cache and message broker, found at
+.B http://redis.io/
+
+The \fBredis\-benchmark\fP command is a command to benchmark redis-server.
+
+.SH OPTIONS
+.TP 15
+.B \-h \fIhostname\fP
+Server hostname (default: 127.0.0.1).
+.TP
+.B \-p \fIport\fP
+Server port (default: 6379).
+.TP
+.B \-s \fIsocket\fP
+Server socket (overrides hostname and port).
+.TP
+.B \-a \fIpassword\fP
+Password to use when connecting to the server.
+.TP
+.B \-c \fIclients\fP
+Number of parallel connections (default 50)
+.TP
+.B \-dnnum \fIdb\fP
+SELECT the specified db number (default 0)
+.TP
+.B \-k \fIboolean\fP
+1=keep alive 0=reconnect (default 1)
+.TP
+.B \-r \fIkeyspacelen\fP
+Use random keys for SET/GET/INCR, random values for SADD
+Using this option the benchmark will expand the string __rand_int__
+inside an argument with a 12 digits number in the specified range
+from 0 to keyspacelen-1. The substitution changes every time a command
+is executed. Default tests use this to hit random keys in the
+specified range.
+.TP
+.B \-P \fInumreq\fP
+Pipeline <numreq> requests. Default 1 (no pipeline).
+.TP
+.B \-e
+If server replies with errors, show them on stdout.
+(no more than 1 error per second is displayed)
+.TP
+.B \-q
+Quiet. Just show query/sec values
+.TP
+.B \-\-csv
+Output in CSV format
+.TP
+.B \-l
+Loop. Run the tests forever
+.TP
+.B \-t \fItests\fP
+Only run the comma separated list of tests. The test
+names are the same as the ones produced as output.
+.TP
+.B \-I
+Idle mode. Just open N idle connections and wait.
+
+.SH EXAMPLES
+.TP 5
+Run the benchmark with the default configuration against 127.0.0.1:6379:
+$ redis\-benchmark
+.TP
+Use 20 parallel clients, for a total of 100k requests, against 192.168.1.1:
+$ redis-benchmark \-h 192.168.1.1 \-p 6379 \-n 100000 \-c 20
+.TP
+Fill 127.0.0.1:6379 with about 1 million keys only using the SET test:
+$ redis\-benchmark \-t set \-n 1000000 \-r 100000000
+.TP
+Benchmark 127.0.0.1:6379 for a few commands producing CSV output:
+$ redis\-benchmark \-t ping,set,get \-n 100000 \-\-csv
+.TP
+Benchmark a specific command line:
+$ redis\-benchmark \-r 10000 \-n 10000 eval 'return redis.call("ping")' 0
+.TP
+Fill a list with 10000 random elements:
+$ redis\-benchmark \-r 10000 \-n 10000 lpush mylist __rand_int__
+.TP
+On user specified command lines __rand_int__ is replaced with a random integer
+with a range of values selected by the -r option.
